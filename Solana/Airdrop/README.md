# Solana Token Airdrop Smart Contract

This repository contains the source code for a Solana smart contract designed to manage token minting and airdrop operations. The code is written in Rust and utilizes the [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/) framework for Solana smart contract development. It also uses the Solana Program Library (SPL) token module for token-related operations.

## Overview

The smart contract provides the following functionality:

1.  **Initialize Mint**: The `initialize_mint` function allows the initialization of a token mint with a specified number of decimals. This function sets up the token mint account and its associated parameters.
    
2.  **Perform Airdrop**: The `airdrop` function facilitates the distribution of tokens to users. It retrieves the bump seed for the mint authority, creates a signer for the mint authority, and then transfers tokens to the user's token account using the `token::mint_to` function from the SPL token module.
    

## Code Structure

Here's an overview of the key components and structures in the code:

-   **Imported Modules**: The code imports necessary modules and dependencies, including Anchor, SPL token, and related data structures.
    
-   **Program ID Declaration**: The unique program ID is declared using the `declare_id!` macro. This ID uniquely identifies the smart contract on the Solana blockchain.
    
-   **Program Module**: Within the `airdrop_program` module, two functions are defined: `initialize_mint` and `airdrop`. These functions handle mint initialization and airdrop operations, respectively.
    
-   **Account Structures**: The code defines two account structures:
    
    -   `InitializeMint`: Represents the accounts required for initializing a token mint. It includes the token mint account, mint authority account, payer (transaction initiator), rent sysvar, and program accounts.
        
    -   `Airdrop`: Represents the accounts required for performing an airdrop. It includes the token mint account, mint authority account, user account (signer), user's token account (initialized during airdrop), rent sysvar, and program accounts.
        
-   **Airdrop Implementation**: An implementation block for the `Airdrop` account structure provides a method `mint_to_context`. This method creates a CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) context for the `MintTo` instruction from the SPL token module. It configures the program and accounts needed for this instruction.
    

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with this smart contract on the Solana blockchain, you can follow these general steps:

1.  Set up a Solana development environment.
    
2.  Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
    
3.  Build and deploy the smart contract using the Anchor framework.
    
4.  Interact with the smart contract by invoking its functions, particularly `initialize_mint` and `airdrop`.
